Hi,

I didn't know your email addresses and I couln't get ahold of them
through github... I have worked on cleaning up the scripts and the
program and have tried to get more performance out of block_mm. It
seems like that it now sometimes performs as good as simple_mm, but
usually only somewhat worse than simple_mm, which is probably because
I moved the function body of sub_mm into block_mm to allow some more
aggressive optimizations compiler optimizations. 

You probably want to play around with the block size some more to get
the right flop and cache graphs.

Also you can see that I have added the blocksize/MFLOPS graphing
functions. The graphs that come out of that look really wierd
sometimes and I don't quite know what to make of them. The peak block
size is apparently around 30.
